# Ticket Breakdown

We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**

Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".

You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

For estimating purposes, a grading from 1-5 will be applied. Each value represents a day, being 1 day of effort the minimum and 5 the maximum days on a sprint with a 2 week cycle. 5 days is the maximum to allow for back and forth in reviewing, testing and eventual refactor.

1. Create a database migration file to modify the Agents table to include a new column with the `custom_id` which is unique to each agent, existing entries will be updated with a value of null.
   Update existing tests to account for new column. Add new tests that evaluate the default value of the new column and to ensure the `custom_id` is unique, when proper data is added.

Acceptance Criteria:
Agents database is successfully updated without compromising existing entries.

Estimate:
1

2. Modify the `getShiftsByFacility` function to include the `custom_id` property in the Agent metadata that is returned from each shift.
   Update existing tests for the function to account for new `custom_id`, the tests need to cover the following:

- each agent has a unique database ID
- each agent has a custom_id column defaulted to null

Acceptance Criteria:
The lists of Shifts returned by `getShiftsByFacility` include a `custom_id` for the agent metadata for each shift

Estimate
2

3. Create a new method that fetches the shifts using the unique custom_id, then make the necessary updates to `generateReport` function to use the new list of shifts generated using the custom_id. This function needs to be backwards compatible, which means if a `custom_id` is set to null, the report is still generated using list of shifts fetched by facility.

Acceptance Criteria:
`generateReport` can now generate a report based on a list of shifts generated by the new method;
Test the flows:

- `generateReport` takes a list of shifts, either generated using the new added method or the existing list from `getShiftsByFacility`

Estimate
4

4. Update any API endpoint or UI to allow the Facility to add a `custom_id` for each Agent. This includes adding validation to ensure the value is unique for each agent. This includes updating the PDF template generated to display the custom_id, if available;

Acceptance Criteria:
Facility can add a unique custom ID for each new Agent; Facility can update an Agent profile with a unique custom ID.
Unit tests for each validation;
Integration tests that assert the user flows:

- Facility adds a new Agent with a unique custom_id, the value added is added to the Agent table
- Facility updates existing Agent with a unique custom_id, the Agent table is updated with the new value successfully

Estimate
2

5. Update all the necessary UI to allow the Facility to add a new custom id or update an Agent profile. This includes adding validation to ensure the value is unique for each agent. This includes updating the PDF template generated to display the custom_id, if available;

Acceptance Criteria:
Facility can add a unique custom ID for each new Agent; Facility can update an Agent profile with a unique custom ID.
Unit tests for each validation and the following cases:

- UI indicates to Facility that a value has to be unique and it will be used to generate the report
- Report include the custom_id added by Facility

Estimate
2
